== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I change the styles? =
By default WP Post Accordion comes bundled with a default style and class selector called `default-accordion` - you can see an example of how the accordion is styled by examining the `default-accordion` class in this plugins style.css file. When you add the widget to a sidebar you have the option to change both the id and class selectors. By setting these two values, you will have the opportunity to define custom styles in your themes style.css file.

= How do I change which posts are displayed? =
You have full control over which posts are displayed through the use of the query string. For more information on how to use the query string see the documentation here: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/query_posts

= How do I change the active slide? =
Slides are numbered from the left starting with one. By default the first slide is active. When you add the widget to the sidebar, you have the option to set which slide is active. If you want the third slide to be the active slide, you would place the number 3 in the input field.
